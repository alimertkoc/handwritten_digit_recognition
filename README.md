# Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST Dataset) - CNN Training

This is a training project for image classification. I followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBlO87ZAiiw) on YouTube.

Simply I tried to understand CNNs and Pytorch basics.

Added .ipynb version of the main.py for easier use and test the model with visual outputs.
